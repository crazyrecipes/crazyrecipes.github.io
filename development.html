            <h3>Update 3/30/2023</h3>
            <p>
                We are presently working on our backend & database for presentation next week. We plan to make the API as complete
                as possible, with all the functionality demonstrated with the mock API used in the frontend demonstration. Smaller additions to the frontend,
                such as timers or notification banners, are also being worked on. We are also working on establishing our database in
                PostgreSQL.
            </p>

            <h3>Update 3/9/2023</h3>
            <p>
                We are presenting our frontend today. All API calls are implemented using a mock API.
                We have tested reading, searching, creating, editing, and deleting recipes, as well 
                as viewing and updating ingredients and implements in the pantry. We have also implemented 
                setting and retrieving user allergens.
            </p>

            <h3>Update: 3/8/2023</h3>
            <p>
                After a long wait, our first build of the frontend is now fully functional.
                Our focus is now turning to the backend and database.
            </p>
